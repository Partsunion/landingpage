# Upstream provenance and local patch

This package is a scoped Partsunion fork of the upstream braces@3.0.3 npm package. The source was copied from the immutable npm tarball https://registry.npmjs.org/braces/-/braces-3.0.3.tgz with SRI SHA-512 sha512-yQbXgO/OSZVD2IsiLlro+7Hf6Q18EJrKSEsdoMzKePKXct3gvD8oLcOQdIzGupr5Fj+EDe8gO/lxc1BzfMpxvA==. The upstream MIT LICENSE file is retained.

Local changes add a maximum recursive group nesting depth of 100 before parsing can hand input to recursive walkers, plus iterative AST depth checks at the public compile, expand, and stringify entry points so caller-provided ASTs cannot bypass the limit. The scoped package version 3.0.3-partsunion.1 identifies this local fork; it does not claim an upstream braces release.

The guard addresses GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm / CVE-2026-93687. The upstream advisory lists no patched release. Regression coverage exercises the public APIs and the installed Landing ESLint consumer path through @next/eslint-plugin-next, fast-glob, and micromatch.

The fork also removes the upstream close-node debug log from compilation. Pattern content must not be printed to consumer or CI logs. The fork is installed from this versioned source tree; release source commits and artifact hashes bind its exact bytes.
